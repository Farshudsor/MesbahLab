execute MPC.m to run clossed loop simulations of the bubble column, using MPC to adjust dilution. 

predictions are made with prediction.m

process simulations are done by calling main.m
-- main.m has been modified from the original files by Henderson et. al to be a function that accepts the dilution rate and most recent states, and returns the new states
